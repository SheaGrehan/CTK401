                    Okay, good. I think I meant everything I’ve heard makes it sorta feel like a hundred hours on and 2 off, so to put in all that time into something, you really got to love it and when it’s that hard isn’t it hard to love?

                    Isn’t the restaurant a hundred hours on and 2 off?

                Yep, of course he is. I’m sorry it’s your problem.(then) Are you full time here yet?

                Splitting time. Don’t tell Pete. Hey so I’ve been trying give Rich stupid shit to do, can he start ordering pantry stuff?

                SYDNEY
                    
                Trying. Menu’s not done. I keep trying to finalize it and Carmy is pulled in a million directions. And now he--(stopping herself) Sorry. I know he’s your brother.
                    
                SUGAR

                I left, you know? And then I came back. And now that I’m back, ever since I came back, I think I’ve been searching for some feeling. Some reassurance? Or... certainty? I just... I’m putting everything into this place, you know? So I just hope he is too.
                    
                Sugar nods, yep.
