                I’m spillin’ shit everywhere. And
                I’m behind on the lobster. Carm, is
                Cousin Sarah’s friend Pedro gay?
                
                Donna moves fast, manic-make-you-nervous-fast. Way too much
                for one person and she’s sweating. You can smell the onions
                and garlic and whitefish.
                CARMY
                
                Is who gay? Mom you don’t have to
                make all seven fishes, no one eats
                this shit--
                DONNA
                
                Pedro. He seems gay like arty you
                know. Effeminate. I love him, I’m
                just saying he seems gay and it’s
                tradition--
                CARMY
                
                It’s tradition that Pedro’s gay?

                Carmen. No. The seven fishes are
                tradition, baby. Why do you think
                I’ve been doing this since 4am--
                
                CARMY
                
                Okay well what can I do--
                
                DONNA
                
                You can fix the forks please.
                
                CARMY

                K-- you sure you want to use these
                nice ones?
                DONNA
                
                Yes, baby, for the seven fishes--
                
                CARMY
                Ma, we can be casual--
                DONNA
                
                Honey just do it don’t make me ask
                you five times--

                Faks out, delicate operation--

                And now it’s later. Got it. Shoot.

                RICHIE
                (deep breath)
                I’m gonna have this kid, I can’t
                be, you know, wrapping up
                sandwiches forever. I know you do a
                lot of different things and you
                probably could use some help. I
                could be good. Mike too. I’ve been
                looking. There’s not like a lot out
                there. You’re somebody that knows
                some things. We both don’t wanna be
                in The Beef everyday, you know, I
                mean that makes sense right? Feel
                like I’m wasting potential.

                CICERO
                What kind of potential?
                RICHIE

                I dunno, potential to do something.
                I feel like I’m really good with
                people but like I don’t what the
                outlet is you know? And like I
                never had like... an uncle or
                mentor--

                CICERO

                I am neither of those things.

                RICHIE

                But you know what I’m saying.

                CICERO

                I do not.

                RICHIE

                I’m saying like you could teach me
                you know? I could learn from you
                and you could teach me stuff.

                CICERO

                You want me to teach you stuff?

                RICHIE
                Like in business--
                CICERO

                You want a job. I get it.

                RICHIE
                Think about it?

                THE BEAR #206 Network Draft - 11/14/22 18.

                CICERO
                (pats his shoulder)
                I will think about it.
                Cicero turns toward the kitchen...
                SUGAR (O.S.)

                Ma. Can I help?

                DONNA (O.S.)
                (laughs)
                I think we’re good, Angel. I don’t
                want to have tell everybody why I
                call you Sugar again. I’m joking
                sweetie I love you--

                Cicero enters kitchen. Sugar annoyed. Sick of this story--

                SUGAR
                Everybody knows why.
                CICERO
                I don’t know why.

                Donna impressively pulls bright red lobsters from a pot.
                Sugar moves two WINE BOTTLES, looks to Carm--

            CHEF TERRY * (shakes her head) You close with your father?

            (Richie shakes head) I learned the most about him when I was packing his house up, all his belongings, all his life. I found a stack of these pocket notebooks, must have carried them with him when he was on tour. He would write about some palm trees he saw, escargot he tried, this time the ocean looked purple, all these little details. The way he wrote them, felt more like a reminder. Like don’t forget this moment, don’t forget this strange interesting thing. There were hundreds of these entries, he’d would always sign off the same way--</p>
