                Because this restaurant opened
                twelve years ago and was voted best
                restaurant in the world the same
                year. It’s retained three stars
                since the doors opened with a
                waitlist that’s long, like really
                long, like 5000 people at any given
                moment. It’s outrageously expensive
                because we set standards that are
                so outrageous it takes the toll and
                the time from a team of 200 people
                to keep it in orbit because at any
                given moment, one of those 5000
                people might be given a chance to
                spend a large amount of their time
                and money here and they will have
                outrageous expectations.
                (then)
                So we’re gonna need to have forks
                that don’t have streaks on them.

                You don’t have to drink the kool-
                aid, but if you’re going to stay
                
                you need to have some respect for
                me, the rest of the staff, for the
                diners and for your self.
                
                Richie calculates, then:
                RICHIE
                
                ... Respect. I can do that.

                Okay so -- on the good stuff, like
                the really fancy expensive stuff,
                they have stacked layers of steel
                that are “clad” together, see how
                this cheap stuff is like light and
                
                bendable? The bottom of the good-
                good is heavy and robust and they
                
                can handle really high heat really
                quickly and really evenly because
                in between the steel there’s an
                aluminum core.
                MARCUS
                
                You’re an aluminum core.

                CICERO Kill me. Ladies and germs I’m little concerned we’re taking our eye off the ball a bit here and I want to be-- (sees Richie about to speak) Shut the fuck up hyper clear: I do not like pissing money away and not seeing progress. I’m calling it out now because I foresee more money being pissed away down the line and I like to control the pissing to the best of my ability shut the fuck up Richard and we’re already a month in and the schedule is kinked, the place is a mess and people are making sandwiches. As much as I look forward to selling this place, and I do look forward to it, it’s in all of our best interest to have a maximally efficient place of business. I’m gonna tell you a story about failure-- Sydney pops her head in.
